# altV-better-notify

This Project will be Open-Source because I want to share it so other people can have a Notification System together with an Queue System

It was made by me while i was working on our RP Project nowV.

### Setup

The project uses yarn as an package-manager

It also includes storybook to design/develop the notifications faster.

`yarn install` or `yarn` to install node_modules
